            <h2 id="triassic-period">The  Triassic Period ~ 252 - 201 million years ago</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="time-period-content">   
            <div class="align-left time-period-text">
                <p>
                    The Triassic period was a time of massive change on Earth and can be split into the Early (252 - 247 million years ago), Middle (247 - 237 million years ago) and Late (237 - 201 million years ago) Triassics. It began some 252 million years ago after the worst-ever extinction event. Known as "The Great Dying", it wiped out up to 90% of all species, animals and plants alike. It's thought that it took a few million years for the Earth to recover.
                <br>
                <br>
                    During the Triassic, Earth did not have continents - instead, there was one giant landmass called <strong>Pangaea</strong>. To the west was the Panthalassic Ocean; to the east, The Tethys. Given the vast size of this super-continent, the environment varied greatly and as it recovered from The Great Dying, trees such as conifers reaching 30 metres tall grew in large forests and gave way to ferns in drier regions. As animals recovered, so did mammal-like reptiles such as the <strong>Lystrosaurus</strong>. The first amphibians evolved in freshwater regions to live alongside the existing Temnospondyls such as <strong>Mastodonsaurus</strong> (something like a modern-day crocodile), while <strong>Ichthyosaurs</strong> evolved in the seas. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                    At the same time, <strong>Sphenodonts</strong> appeared (seen today as the Tuatara - a species that looks like a lizard, but is from a different heritage) which would give rise to orders like <strong>Plesiosauria</strong>. While the Early Triassic was dominated mostly by mammal-like reptiles, the Middle Triassic saw a diverse range of <strong>archosaurs</strong> appear which would give way to dinosaurs, birds, crocodiles, turtles and pterosaurs. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    Groups like <strong>Aetosaurs</strong>, <strong>drepanosaurs</strong>, <strong>phytosaurs</strong> and the incredible <strong>Tanystropheus</strong> were quite successful. <strong>Pterosaurs</strong> appeared during the Middle Triassic and are the earliest known vertebrates to have powered flight. By the Late Triassic, archosaurs dominated the Earth. 
                <br>
                <br>
                    The change on Earth during the Triassic period was not limited to plant and animal life - the climate changed too. So much so that by 201 million years ago, the end of the Triassic period, Earth experienced another <a href="extinction.html">mass-extinction event</a> and Pangea began to break up.

                    Spanning 56 million years, the Jurrasic period can also be split into the Early (201 - 174 million years ago), Middle (174 - 164 million years ago) and Late (164 - 145 million years ago) Jurassics.

                <br>
                    In the Early Jurassic, <strong>Pangaea</strong> continued to split with the northern half broken into North America and Eurasia. The southern half began to split in the Middle Jurrasic and east (Antartica, Madagascar, India and Australia) split from west (Africa and South America). New oceans were formed in the spaces between these land masses and mountains rose on the sea floor, pushing sea levels higher. 
                <br>
                <br>    
                    Marine life such as plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs had survived extinction and now dominated the seas and oceans. On land, the Early Jurassic saw dinosaurs such as <strong>Dilophosaurus</strong>, <strong>Vulcanodon</strong>, <strong>Anchisaurus</strong> and <strong>Scutellosaurus</strong> thrive, while <strong>Apatosaurus</strong>, <strong>Brachiosaurus</strong>, <strong>Diplodocus</strong>, <strong>Allosaurus</strong> and <strong>Stegosaurus</strong> flourished in the Late Jurassic.
                <br>
                <br>
                    <strong>Archaeopteryx</strong>, though to be a transitional fossil between non-avian dinosaurs and birds, also evolved in the Late Jurassic.
