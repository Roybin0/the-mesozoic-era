                <h3>Triassic Period ~ 252 - 201 million years ago</h3>
                <p>
                    The Triassic Period was a time of great change on Earth and can be split into the Early (252 - 247m years ago), Middle (247 - 237m years ago) and Late (237 - 201m years ago) Triassics. It began after the worst-ever extinction event; known as "The Great Dying", it wiped out up to 90% of all species, animals and plants alike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the Triassic, Earth had one giant landmass called <strong>Pangaea</strong>. The environment varied greatly and as it recovered from The Great Dying, conifers reaching 30 metres tall grew in large forests and gave way to ferns in drier regions. As animals recovered, mammal-like reptiles like the <strong>Lystrosaurus</strong> and the first amphibians evolved in freshwater to live alongside existing Temnospondyls like <strong>Mastodonsaurus</strong> (something like a modern-day crocodile), and <strong>Ichthyosaurs</strong> evolved in the seas. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    At the same time, <strong>Sphenodonts</strong> appeared, which would give rise to groups like <strong>Plesiosauria</strong>. While the Early Triassic was dominated mostly by mammal-like reptiles, the Middle Triassic saw a diverse range of <strong>archosaurs</strong> appear. These would later lead to dinosaurs, birds, crocodiles, turtles and pterosaurs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Groups like <strong>Aetosaurs</strong>, <strong>Phytosaurs</strong> and the incredible <strong>Tanystropheus</strong> were quite successful. <strong>Pterosaurs</strong> appeared during the Middle Triassic and are the earliest known vertebrates to have powered flight. By the Late Triassic, archosaurs dominated the Earth. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The change on Earth during the Triassic period was not limited to plant and animal life. By the end of the Triassic period, Earth experienced another <a href="extinction.html#triassic-extinction">mass-extinction event</a> after massive volcanic activity and Pangea began to break up.

                <h3>Jurassic Period ~ 201 - 145 million years ago</h3>            
                <p>
                    Spanning 56 million years, the Jurrasic period can also be split into the Early (201 - 174m years ago), Middle (174 - 164m years ago) and Late (164 - 145m years ago) Jurassics. It is also known as the Age of the Dinosaurs. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the Early Jurassic, <strong>Pangaea</strong> continued to split into North and South with the northern half broken into North America and Eurasia. The southern half started to split in the Middle Jurrasic and east (Antartica, Madagascar, India and Australia) split from west (Africa and South America). At the end of the Late Jurassic, new oceans, such as the Atlantic, were forming in the spaces between these land masses and mountains rose on the sea floor, pushing sea levels higher. 
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Marine life such as plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs had survived extinction and now dominated the seas and oceans. On land, the Early Jurassic saw dinosaurs such as <strong>Dilophosaurus</strong>, <strong>Vulcanodon</strong>, <strong>Anchisaurus</strong> and <strong>Scutellosaurus</strong> thrive, while <strong>Apatosaurus</strong>, <strong>Brachiosaurus</strong>, <strong>Diplodocus</strong>, <strong>Allosaurus</strong> and <strong>Stegosaurus</strong> flourished in the Late Jurassic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Archaeopteryx</strong>, though to be a transitional fossil between non-avian dinosaurs and birds, also evolved in the Late Jurassic. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The end of the Jurassic Period saw several species of dinosaur die out, which would give rise to the Cretaceous period, however this extinction was not as severe as the one at the beginning of the Jurassic period.

                <h3>Cretaceous Period ~ 145 - 66 million years ago</h3>
                <p>
                    The longest time period in the Mesozic Era, the Cretaceous period last 79 million years and can be divided into the Early Cretaceous (145 - 100m years ago) and the Late Cretaceous (100 - 66m years ago).
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the Early Cretaceous saw the Earth's landmasses essentially look like two large continents, the narrow waterways that were spreading brought great diversity. As the <strong>Late Cretaceous</strong> started, continents as we know them today had formed, separating the dinosaurs and allowing each to evolve suit their own environment. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Early Cretaceous saw well-known dinosaurs like <strong>Spinosaurus</strong>, <strong>Giganotosaurus</strong> and <strong>Iguanodon</strong> evolve. In the seas, Plesiosaurus and Ichthyosaurus were eventually joined by <strong>Mosasaurus</strong>. Although the film was called <em>Jurassic Park</em>, quite a few of the dinosaurs featured were found during the Late Cretaceous such as <strong>Triceratops</strong>, <strong>Tyrannosaurus</strong> and <strong>Velociraptor</strong>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The end of the Cretaceous Period saw another <a href="extinction.html#cretaceous-extinction">massive extinction event</a> and though open to debate, it is widely believed and that an asteroid impact is the main culprit. This brought the end of the Age of Dinosaurs as 75% of all plant and animal life was once again wiped out.
