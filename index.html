                    <p>When did these massive creatures roam the Earth? To answer that, let's take a little look at how Earth, and life, has evolved over the last few billion years.
                    <br>Earth is roughly 4.6 billion years old. For a <em>very</em> long time, the Earth was bombarded with asteroids, comets and other foreign objects making it uninhabitable. Scientists believe that these comets brought water and other building blocks of life to our planet.</p>

                    <p>While there is evidence of cyanobacteria (bacteria that is aquatic and photosynthetic, meaning it can manufacture it's own food) on Earth up to 3.5 billion years ago, it wasn't until oxygen and Earth's ozone layer formed that life as we know it began to form. Known as the Cambrian explosion during the Paleozoic Era, life in the form of invertebrates, fish, fungi, plants, amphibians and insects emerged.</p>

                    <p>A massive extinction event at the end of the Paleozoic gave rise to reptiles and dinosaurs. The first dinosaurs on Earth are thought to have evolved about 252 million years ago. The last dinosaurs lived on Earth roughly 66 million years ago.
                    <br>That's 186 million years of dinosaurs! As dinosaurs lived on Earth for so long, we can break this into three separate time periods:
                    <br>- Triassic Period 
                    <br>- Jurassic Period
